# OpenJS Github Continuity Policy

## Summary

This policy is intended to ensure that OpenJS GitHub projects remain accessible and manageable. 

It addresses the following use cases:

- Archiving projects when maintainers are no longer reachable
- Managing projects and users when maintainers are inactive or unreachable
- Adding or removing admins in emergency situations

## Continuity Options for Projects

### Option 1: Add The Executive Director As An Admin

If you select this option, you will add the OpenJS Foundation executive director (currently https://github.com/rginn)  as an admin to your project.

### Option 2: Add Your Organization To The OpenJS Enterprise

If you select this option, you will add your Organization to the [OpenJS Foundation enterprise account](https://github.com/enterprises/openjs-foundation). Doing so gives the foundation the option to become an organization owner if necessary.  The admins of the enterprise account are currently limited to the [Executive Director](https://github.com/rginn) and [Director Of Program Management](https://github.com/bensternthal). 

### Option 3: Opt-out

Projects that feel their governance is sufficient to provide continuity may opt out of this policy by requesting an exception from the CPC. This can be done by filing an issue in the [CPC repository](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/issues).
