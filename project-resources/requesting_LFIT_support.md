# Requesting Linux Foundation IT Support 

This guide explains how to request help from the Linux Foundation IT team.

## Who Is This Document For?

This document is for OpenJS projects that have formally engaged with LF IT to support one or more of their services. If you have questions about a non-LF supported service, please contact operations@openjsf.org.

## How To Contact Linux Foundation IT For Support

### Submit an Issue

The preferred way to request IT support is by [filling an issue](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/infrastructure/issues/new?template=IT-SUPPORT-REQUEST.yml) in the [infrastucture repository](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/infrastructure). Note:

* This is a public repository, if you wish to file a confidential request please see the below instructions
* Please use the "IT Support Request Ticket" issue template

### Submitting Confidential Requests

Please submit any confidential requests via [Jira Service Desk](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2).

### Alternate Contact Method: OpenJS Foundation Slack

For less formal inquiries you can reach out to the IT Operations team channel (#lf-it-support) in the [OpenJS Foundation Slack instance](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/).

### How Work Is Prioritized

Critical issues resulting in unplanned downtime will be prioritized over other severity types. Please clearly indicate the urgency of your request in the issue description. Non-critical issues will be addressed according to their severity and order of submission. 

### Viewing The Status Of Your Request

All non-confidential issues are tracked via a public [Github project board](https://github.com/orgs/openjs-foundation/projects/10).

## What To Do In An Emergency

In the event of an emergency (e.g., a critical system is down or there is a security incident), you can use Jira to request priority support 24/7.

1. Please fill out the following ticket in Jira [(Report a serious problem](https://jira.linuxfoundation.org/plugins/servlet/desk/portal/2/create/30))
2. Set urgency and impact appropriately

## Have A Unique Situation?
